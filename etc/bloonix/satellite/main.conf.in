# Section: proc_manager
#
# This section is used to configure the parameter for the process
# manager of bloonix.
#
# Parameter: min_spare_servers
#
# This parameter sets the desired minimum numbers of idle child processes.
# If less than min_spare_servers processes are in idle state, then new
# processes will be forked until the count of min_spare_servers is reached.
#
# Default: 10
#
# Parameter: max_spare_servers
#
# This parameter sets the desired maximum number of idle child processes.
# If equal or more than max_spare_servers processes are in idle state,
# then the excess processes will be killed.

# This parameter sets the absolute maximum number of child processes that
# can be forked.
#
# Default: 50

# Parameter: max_requests
#
# This parameter sets how many requests a child process is allowed to
